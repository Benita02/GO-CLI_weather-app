GO CLI WEATHER APP
A command-line weather application written in Go that retrieves weather information using web APIs, parses JSON responses, and utilizes command-line flags. This project demonstrates concepts such as API integration, JSON parsing, command-line input handling, and asynchronous programming using channels.

Description
This project aims to provide a lightweight and efficient solution for developers, weather enthusiasts, and users who prefer accessing weather information from the command line. By making web requests to weather APIs, the application retrieves up-to-date weather data and presents it in a clear and concise manner.
