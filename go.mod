<!-- Dependencies are external software components or libraries that a project relies on to function correctly. 
They are additional pieces of code or resources that are required for the project to work as intended.
 Dependencies can include libraries, frameworks, modules, packages, or other software components that provide 
 specific functionality or resources needed by the project. 
 Managing dependencies involves specifying the required versions and ensuring they are available and properly integrated into the project.


Dependency Management: It manages the required software components and their versions for a Go project.

Version Control: It ensures consistent use of software versions in different environments.

Module Identification: It provides a unique name for the project and its dependencies.

Dependency Resolution: It retrieves and fetches the necessary software components from remote sources.

Semantic Versioning: It follows a versioning scheme to ensure compatibility and stability.

Build Reproducibility: It allows for consistent and repeatable builds by locking dependency versions.

Go Module Compatibility: It enables easy integration with other Go modules and projects.

In summary, a go.mod file acts as a central configuration for managing dependencies and ensuring a reliable development environment for Go projects. -->
